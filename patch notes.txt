V1.02

Reto's energy power has been reworked. It now costs 2 down from 6 and enflames a random enemy item for 50% or your missing HP.
Energy per step has been reduced to 2 to compensate.

V1.01

Decreased Olexa's energy power cost to 1 and increased starting chips. The chips compensate for the assumed early staff upgrade,
and the energy power cost makes for a more balanced power later in the game.

Red Hood now properly requires Red Cards, and has had its Block multiplier increased from 1 to 1.5. This should make it more appropriately balanced with cooldown 2 / fortify.

Typos fixed in Red Hood and Character 4's energy power.
