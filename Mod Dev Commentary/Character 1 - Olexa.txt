NOTE: (You can use the commands `selecthero olexa` or `selecthero petrasPurpleHero1` to select Olexa from the character select screen)

Olexa's kit is the most vanilla of the bunch. I wanted Olexa to have a mage-like feel to his character, and so gave him the staff of perfection, 
his trademark blue cloak, and a scroll of magic mapping.

The problem with those three items alone is that a level 1 staff of perfection deals practically no damage, 
and I'd have to recreate the staff of perfection if I wanted to give it at level two as starting equipment.

So, I decided to solve the problem indirectly, by adding a bottled blacksmith to his lineup.

When designing the energy power, I wanted to make a 2 cost power that felt somewhat magicky, since at the time the rest of my energy powers all cost 3 or more.

On browsing the item list, I was inspired by the Shockstone family of items, and here we are now.

Originally, I was planning to give Olexa's character twin daggers, one a Hexblade, and one a Dagger of Darkness.
However, this proved to be extremely uninteresting to play, so I redesigned the kit to what we have now!
