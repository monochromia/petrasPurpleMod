When I was designing Retromation's character, Reto, I couldn't help but think about SamCaron55's Ziggurat 2 art and imagining Reto as a pyromancer.

The big theme I wanted to incorporate here was Red Cards, to match Reto's trademark red hoodie.

So I started with Conjure Flame, a very fundamental item. In and of itself, Conjure Flame is simply a sword that does extra damage with hearts, reskinned to Enflame instead of Attack.

Then came Red Hood. Red Hood starts to get more interesting, in that it requires Red Cards but only gains the bonus effect with diamonds specifically.

Where things are intended to become an interesting decision-making process is when Conjure Flame and Red Hood exist together and compete for cards.
Do you want to use your hearts for Conjure Flame to deal more enflame or use them in Red Hood to throw up block?
Are those big diamonds worth saving for the fortification bonus, or do you spend them now to apply more Enflame?

Finally, the energy power is a risk-reward power similar to vampire's but focused all on damage. How confident are you in your ability to block? How low are you willing to go to apply more Enflame?
