NOTE: (You can use the commands selecthero furlexa or selecthero petrasPurpleHero2 to select Furlexa from the character select screen)

Character 2 is Furlexa, a character based on silly community in-joke about Olexa being a furry (which he is not actually, as far as I know).

"Tainted Olexa" is a reference to binding of isaac repentance, where there are unlockable alternate versions of characters, called "tainted [characterName]".

The reason I went with Furlexa is that I wanted to add some good, lighthearted humor to the mod.
However, game-play wise, I think the character is pretty fun!

Our first item is the Throne of Porcelain. This is a base game item I found while browsing the files.
I had the energy power designed already, and needed an item that provided a good amount of curse, so, given the jokey nature of Furlexa, I had to use the Throne of Porcelain.

Second is "Huggy Wuggy". I knew from the beginning I wanted to give Furlexa an item that charmed, and when I found the "embrace" art in the game files, I had to run from there.

Finally is another base game item "A Gift", though this one might only be encountered during certain seasonal events.
A gift gives random items, and as I was designing Furlexa's kit, I thought to how one of Olexa's favorite isaac characters is Eden, who starts with random items.
Here's to good RNG!
