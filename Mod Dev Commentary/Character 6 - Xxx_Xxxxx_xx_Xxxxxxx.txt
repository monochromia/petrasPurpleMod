NOTE: (You can use the commands selecthero wheel or selecthero petrasPurpleHero6 to select The Wheel of Fortune from the character select screen.)

The Wheel of Fortune was inspired when I thought about the modding API's limit on how many equipment could be given to the player.

I considered what the design for a character who had a unique equipment for every card would look like (like Scathach from Dicey Dungeons).

Thus, the wheel of fortune was borne.

The alliterative naming scheme was a fun idea, and made it helped play into the theme of a slot machine/wheel based chance game.

I decided that I wanted to represent a different damage type for each equipment, and knew poison had to be at the top as it feels the most valuable.

From there, things flowed smoothly. The only art that really made sense was the portraits of kings and queens and jacks, so I used those, and even managed one of each suit.
(Though I couldn't find anything besides Sergent Toad to represent the Ace of Clubs, even though he's used as a Jack of Clubs in the deck...)

The character was a bit fragile, so I added in the 10's Tower Shield, and after some feedback from the devs, I made the items weightless and reduced the wheel's item slots to 0.

And thus: The Wheel of Fortune.
